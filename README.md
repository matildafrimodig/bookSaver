# BookSaver

bookSaver is a webbapplication which allows the user to search for books via the [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books/). 
The application also allows the user to save books in a readinglist. This list is saved in the browser.

## Participants

This project was created by Matilda Frimodig, John HÃ¥kansson and Tom Lanhed Sivertsson. 
During the development the VSCode extension [LiveShare](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/live-share/) was used. This means that all group members collaborated when writing the code. 

## Choice of framework

The application was created in React JS. When selecting which framework to use Vue JS and Angular JS were also considered. 
React was eventually chosen due to a few key factors:

React is according to several sources easy to learn and get started with [1,2]. As we are fairly inexperienced when it comes to front-end development and also the limited time frame of this project, the relatively short learning curve when compared to both Vue and Angular was an important factor. 

While Angular's support for typescript made it appealing since we are more comfortable with typed languages, the complex syntax and the variety of different structures meant it would have taken longer to get started. 

React is also the most popular framework when looking at job applications [1]. In one study 78% of all open job applications requested React experience. Less than 1% requested experience with Vue and 21 percent requested experience with Angular. This also motivated our choice as experience with React seems to valued far higher in the job market. 

Another downside of Vue is that the community is far smaller. This meant that potential bugs or issues might not be as easily fixed to the lack of online knowledge sharing. 

React is also recommended when building small scale projects with simple front-end designs [1].
